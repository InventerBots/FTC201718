/**
 * Created by Luke on 10/12/2017.
 * <p>
 * This is a basic TeleOp mode for learning basic motor commands. There is a Autonomous training sample at {@link BasicAutoumonumsMode}
 * <p>
 * This mode will teach:
 * Motor declaration and initialisation
 * Setting the mode of a motor
 * Setting the speed of a motor
 * Using a gamepad to control a motor
 * Basic POV (point of view) control
 */

/**
 * @TeleOp allows the program to be run on the Drive Station phone as a TeleOp mode.
 * "name" sets the name that will be displayed on the dropdown window for the TeleOp modes. If no name is set, the class name (ie. BasicTeleOpMode)
 * will be displayed
 * "group" organises the OpModes in the dropdown window. If the group is  not set, then this OpMode will not be sorted.
 *
 * @Disabled makes this OpMode "invisible" on the dropdown mode selection window. Comment out (ctrl + / or //) to view in the dropdown mode selection window.

		 * Run Modes:
		 *
		 * There are five modes that the motors can be run in:
		 * RUN_TO_POSITION, RUN_USING_ENCODER, RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER, RESET_ENCODER, STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER
		 *
		 * RUN_USING_ENCODER:
		 * This mode uses the encoder of the motor to maintain a constant speed using a PID loop "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller".
		 * This mode requires the encoder to be connected to the REV Expansion Hub.
		 *
		 * RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER:
		 * This mode does not use the encoder of the motor, it just sets the speed and doesn't change it.
		 * This mode does not require the encoder to be connected to the REV Expansion Hub.
		 *
		 * RUN_TO_POSITION:
		 * This mode will run the motor until the encoder reaches a target that is set using this command: motor.setTargetPosition(int position)
		 * This mode requires the encoder to be connected to the REV Expansion Hub.
		 *
		 * RESET_ENCODER:
		 * This mode will reset the encoder position. It is not required to reset the encoder at any time, if the new target position is added to the
		 * current position.
		 *
		 * STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER:
		 * This mode will stop the motor and reset the encoder position. It is not required to reset the encoder at any time, if the new target position is added to the
		 * current position.
		 *
		 * NOTE:
		 * RUN_USING_ENCODER is the most common mode used on the drive, or anything that needs constant power.
